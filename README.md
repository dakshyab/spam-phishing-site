# spam_phishing_site
(WIP)
A python script that can be used to spam a phishing site with a tons of realistic-looking requests.

Recently i have seen a rise of fake giveaways and promotion ads on Facebook which when clicked on eventually leads to a fake Facebook login site. The ads have plenty of interactions which suggests people have been falling victim to it.
